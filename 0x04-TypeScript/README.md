# 📘 TypeScript Student Table

## Description
This project is a simple TypeScript application bundled with **Webpack**.  
It demonstrates how to define interfaces, use strong typing, and manipulate the DOM using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

The app defines a `Student` interface, creates two student objects, and dynamically renders their **first names** and **locations** inside an HTML table.
